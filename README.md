# GerryGrid
This is the code used to generate and exhaustively search the space of 5x5 voter distributions on a grid, and test them on all possible districting plans. It outputs a datafile containing information about the distribution of votes won (over all districting plans), as well as an index that allows tracing back to a specific voter distribution. This is part of research into "Clustering and Bipartisan Gerrymandering". 

More documentation can be found in the individual notebooks.
